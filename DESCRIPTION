Description: The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is an XML-based
    language which provides a way for applications to define statistical and
    data mining models and to share models between PMML compliant applications.
    More information about PMML and the Data Mining Group can be found at http://
    www.dmg.org. The generated PMML can be imported into any PMML consuming
    application, such as the Zementis ADAPA and UPPI scoring engines which allow for
    predictive models built in R to be deployed and executed on site, in the cloud
    (Amazon, IBM, and FICO), in-database (IBM Netezza, Pivotal, Sybase IQ, Teradata
    and Teradata Aster) or Hadoop (Datameer and Hive).
